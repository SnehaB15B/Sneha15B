# Diabetes Prediction Model

This project is a simple diabetes prediction model using Logistic Regression. It utilizes the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset to train a machine learning model that can predict whether a person has diabetes based on various medical attributes.

## Features Used:

- Number of Pregnancies
- Glucose Level
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin Level
- Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age

## Technologies Used:

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/diabetes-prediction.git
   cd diabetes-prediction
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python diabetes_prediction.py
   ```

## How to Use

1. The script will load and preprocess the dataset.
2. It will train a Logistic Regression model.
3. You can enter patient details when prompted to check the risk of diabetes.
4. The model will output whether the person is Diabetic ðŸ©¸ or Non-Diabetic âœ….

## Model Accuracy

The model achieves approximately **X%** accuracy on the test dataset (actual accuracy is printed when the script runs).

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute by improving the model, adding new features, or optimizing the prediction.
